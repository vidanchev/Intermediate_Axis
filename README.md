# Purpose of this repo

I first saw this video in 2015 when I was a 1st year Bachelor student. 
I had learned enough to describe it mathematically and got a perturbative solution in 2016. 
I then made an Octave script to solve it numerically in 2018. 
This repo's purpose is to rewrite this code in Python and provide it to others who are interested in the phenomenology of the process.
I will also add mathematical description and perturbative description to be used for comparison with the numerical results!
